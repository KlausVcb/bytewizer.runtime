## Getting Started

We encourage users to play with the samples and test programs. See the working [Samples](https://github.com/bytewizer/microserver/tree/master/samples) for an example of how to use packages. The [Playground](https://github.com/bytewizer/microserver/tree/master/playground) also includes many working examples.

## Continuous Integration

**main** :: This is the branch containing the latest release build. No contributions should be made directly to this branch. The development branch will periodically be merged to the main branch, and be released to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=bytewizer.tinyclr).

**develop** :: This is the development branch to which contributions should be proposed by contributors as pull requests. Development build packages are available as attached artifacts on successful build [workflows](https://github.com/bytewizer/microserver/actions/workflows/actions.yml).
